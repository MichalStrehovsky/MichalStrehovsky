# Hi there

I'm Michal, I live in Slovakia, and I work remotely at the .NET Runtime team at Microsoft.

In my spare time I work on C#-related side projects that I find fun but don't particularly overlap with my day job. I maintain the [bflat](https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/bflat) compiler - a C# compiler with Go-like tooling to build small and selfconained apps by default. You might also know me from my greatest hits such as "[Let's make C# run on Windows 3.11!](https://twitter.com/MStrehovsky/status/1215331352352034818)", "[How about a snake game in C# running on DOS?](https://twitter.com/MStrehovsky/status/1218966180104458240)". I also write articles such as the one on how I built a fully [self-contained game in C# in 8 kilobytes](https://medium.com/@MStrehovsky/building-a-self-contained-game-in-c-under-8-kilobytes-74c3cf60ea04?sk=334b06f72dad47f15d0ba0cc6a502487).
